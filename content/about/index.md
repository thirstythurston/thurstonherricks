I am a multidisciplinary scientist with skillsets of both a biologist and a engineer. My research projects have ranged from synthesizing and characterizing [nanoparticles](/projects/nanoparticles/) to conducting clinical malaria studies in Africa using microfluidic devices that I designed and fabricated.  I have extensive experience in developing [microfluidic](/projects/malaria-research/) and [microscopy based assays](/projects/odelay/) to obtain quantitative measurements of living organisms. These assays were developed by leveraging a wide range of skills, including cell culture, [mechanical equipment design](https://doi.org/10.1039/C1LC20131J), [microfluidic device fabrication](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2009.01334.x), [formulating novel cell-culture reagents](https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201706044), and creating [automated microscope controls as well as automated data processing pipelines](http://doi.org/10.1534/g3.116.037044) [on high-performance computing clusters](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56613).
  
When I am not trying to develop new machine learning and AI skillsets, I can be found at the bouldering at the climbing gym, biking around the mid-Peninsula, drinking too much coffee, etc.
